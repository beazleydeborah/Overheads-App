With Christ In The Vessel

With Christ in the vessel
we can smile at the storm
smile at the storm
smile at the storm
With Christ in the vessel
we can smile at the storm
As we go sailing home

Sailing, sailing home
Sailing, sailing home
With Christ in the vessel
we can smile at the storm
As we go sailing home
