John 3:12-18
=
<small>(12)</small> If I told you earthly things and you
do not believe, how will you believe if
I tell you heavenly things? <small>(13)</small> No one
has ascended into heaven, but He who
descended from heaven: the Son of
Man. <small>(14)</small> As Moses lifted up the serpent
in the wilderness, even so must the
Son of Man be lifted up; <small>(15)</small> so that
whoever believes will in Him have
eternal life.
=
<small>(16)</small> For God so loved the world, that
He gave His only begotten Son, that
whoever believes in Him shall not perish,
but have eternal life.  <small>(17)</small> For God did
not send the Son into the world to judge
the world, but that the world might be
saved through Him. <small>(18)</small> He who believes
in Him is not judged; he who does not
believe has been judged already, because
he has not believed in the name of the
only begotten Son of God.
=
<small>(19)</small> This is the judgment, that the
Light has come into the world, 
and men loved the darkness rather
than the Light, for their deeds were evil.
<small>(20)</small> For everyone who does evil hates the
Light, and does not come
to the Light for fear that his
deeds will be exposed. <small>(21)</small> But he who
practices the truth comes to the Light,
so that his deeds may be manifested
as having been wrought in God."
