The Creator Of The Stars
=
Tiny dots of light
In an endless darkness hung
They shine forth in the night
And they speak without a tongue
Jesus chose to put them there
When the world began
And I know that my life too
Is included in His plan
=
So I do not have to worry
Though trials leave their scars
My loving Lord is Jesus Christ
The Creator of the stars
=
Bigger than the sky
Is my Savior's love for me
He came to earth to die
After living perfectly
Now I live to serve Him
What else could I do
And when I go through struggles
I remember He has faced them too
=
So I do not have to worry
Though trials leave their scars
My living Lord is Jesus Christ
The Creator of the stars
