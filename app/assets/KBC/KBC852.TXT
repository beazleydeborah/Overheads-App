1 John 1:5-2:6
=
<small>(5)</small> This is the message we have heard
from Him and announce to you, that
God is Light, and in Him there is no
darkness at all. <small>(6)</small> If we say that we
have fellowship with Him and yet
walk in the darkness, we lie and do
not practice the truth; <small>(7)</small> but if we walk
in the Light as He Himself is in the
Light, we have fellowship with one
another, and the blood of Jesus His
Son cleanses us from all sin.
=
<small>(8)</small> If we say that we have no sin, we
are deceiving ourselves and the truth
is not in us. <small>(9)</small> If we confess our sins,
He is faithful and righteous to forgive
us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. <small>(10)</small> If we say that we
have not sinned, we make Him a liar
and His word is not in us.
=
<small>(2:1)</small> My little children, I am writing
these things to you so that you may
not sin And if anyone sins, we have an
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous; <small>(2)</small> and He Himself is the
propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the
whole world. <small>(3)</small> By this we know that
we have come to know Him, if we keep
His commandments.
=
<small>(4)</small> The one who says, "I have come to
know Him," and does not keep His
commandments, is a liar, and the truth
is not in him; <small>(5)</small> but whoever keeps His
word, in him the love of God has truly
been perfected By this we know that we
are in Him: <small>(6)</small> the one who says he abides
in Him ought himself to walk in the
same manner as He walked.
