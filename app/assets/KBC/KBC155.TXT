They all were used of God
=
Zebedee owned a fish boat,
Jochebed used some tar,
Martha had a kitchen,
Gideon broke a jar,
Balaam rode a donkey,
Elisha made some stew,
Jael used a hammer (Ouch!)
But God used these things too.

Naaman heard his slave girl,
A boy gave fish and bread,
A widow fed Elijah,
Some received their dead.
A poor man saved a city,
A wise man brought some myrrh,
Though their names are not recorded
God knows who they were.
