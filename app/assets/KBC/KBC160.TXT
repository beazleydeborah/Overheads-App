Hear O Lord And Answer
=
Hear O Lord and answer, I am poor and
needy, Guard my life for I am devoted to You
Hear my prayer O Lord and my cry for mercy
In this day of trouble I will call to You

Teach me O Lord, I will walk in Your truth
Give me an undivided heart.
Nations You've made will worship You
For You alone are the living God

I will praise You, I will praise You
Glorify Your name O Lord
I will praise You, I will praise You
Glorify Your name O Lord
