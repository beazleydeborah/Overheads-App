Thy mercy my God

Thy mercy my God
is the theme of my song
The joy of my heart
and the boast of my tongue
Thy free grace alone
from the first to the last
Hath won my affection
and bound my soul fast
=
Without Thy sweet mercy,
I could not live here
Sin would reduce me
to utter despair
But through Thy free goodness,
my spirit's revived
And He that first made me
still keeps me alive
=
Thy mercy is more
than a match for my heart
Which wonders to feel
it's own hardness depart
Dissolved by Thy goodness,
I fall to the ground
And weep for the praise
of the mercy I've found
=
Great father of mercies,
Thy goodness I own
In the covenant love,
Thy crucified son
All praise to the spirit,
whose whisper divine
Seals mercy and pardon
and righteousness mine
=
All praise to the spirit,
whose whisper divine
Seals mercy and pardon
and righteousness mine
