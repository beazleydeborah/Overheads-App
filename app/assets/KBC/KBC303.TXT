I Stand Amazed
=
I stand amazed in the presence 
of Jesus the Nazarene, 
and wonder how he could love me, 
a sinner, condemned, unclean. 
=
How marvelous! How wonderful! 
And my song shall ever be: 
How marvelous! How wonderful 
is my Savior's love for me! 
=
He took my sins and my sorrows, 
he made them his very own; 
he bore the burden to Calvary, 
and suffered and died alone.
=
How marvelous! How wonderful! 
And my song shall ever be: 
How marvelous! How wonderful 
is my Savior's love for me! 
=
When with the ransomed in glory 
his face I at last shall see, 
'twill be my joy through the ages 
to sing of his love for me. 
=
How marvelous! How wonderful! 
And my song shall ever be: 
How marvelous! How wonderful 
is my Savior's love for me!
