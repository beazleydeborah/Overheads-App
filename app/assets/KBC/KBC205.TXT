Jubilee
=
Well He picked me up
Turned me around
Set my feet on higher ground.
Glory, Hallelujah, Jubilee, Jubilee.
Well He gives me peace
He gives me joy
This old world cannot destroy
Glory, Hallelujah, Jubilee, Jubilee.
=
All my life was filled with sorrow
There was not a bright tomorrow.
Days were dark as night;
The light I could not see.
Since He came to me I'm singing
Such a melody is ringing
Glory, Hallelujah, Jubilee.
=
Well He picked me up
Turned me around
Set my feet on higher ground.
Glory, Hallelujah, Jubilee, Jubilee.
