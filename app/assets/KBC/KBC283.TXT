In The Light
=
I keep trying to find a life 
On my own, apart from you 
I am the king of excuses 
I've got one for every
selfish thing I do 
=
What's going on inside of me? 
I despise my own behavior 
This only serves to confirm
my suspicions 
That I'm still a man
in need of a savior 
=
I wanna be in the light 
As you are in the light 
I wanna shine like
the stars in the heavens 
Oh, lord be my light
and be my salvation 
Cause all I want
is to be in the light 
All I want is
to be in the light 
=
The disease of self
runs through my blood 
It's a cancer
fatal to my soul 
Every attempt on my
behalf has failed 
To bring this sickness
under control 
=
Tell me, what's going on
inside of me? 
I despise my own behavior 
This only serves to confirm
my suspicions 
That I'm still a man
in need of a savior 
=
I wanna be in the light 
As you are in the light 
I wanna shine like
the stars in the heavens 
Oh, lord be my light
and be my salvation 
Cause all I want
is to be in the light 
All I want is
to be in the light 
=
Honesty becomes me 
[there's nothing left to lose] 
The secrets that did run me 
[in your presence are defused] 
Pride has no position 
[and riches have no worth] 
The fame that once did cover me 
[has been sentenced to this earth] 
Has been sentenced to this earth 
=
Tell me, what's going on
inside of me? 
I despise my own behavior 
This only serves to confirm
my suspicions 
That I'm still a man
in need of a savior

I wanna be in the light 
As you are in the light

All I want is
to be in the light
