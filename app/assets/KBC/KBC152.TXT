All my heart to Him I give
Ever to Him I'll cling
In His blessed presence live
Ever His praises sing
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul's best songs
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belong

Souls in danger, look above
Jesus completely saves
He will lift you by His love
Out of the angry waves
He's the Master of the sea
Billows His will obey
He your Savior wants to be
Be saved today
