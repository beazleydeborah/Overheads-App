Romans 5:12-16
=
<small><b>(12)</b></small> So then, just as sin
entered the world through
one man and death through
sin, and so death spread
to all people because all
sinned—
=
<small><b>(13)</b></small> for before the law was
given, sin was in the world,
but there is no accounting
for sin when there is no law. 
=
<small><b>(14)</b></small> Yet death reigned from
Adam until Moses even over
those who did not sin in
the same way that Adam
(who is a type of the coming
one) transgressed. 
=
<small><b>(15)</b></small> But the gracious gift
is not like the transgression.
For if the many died through
the transgression of the one
man, how much more did the
grace of God and the gift by
the grace of the one man Jesus
Christ multiply to the many!
=
<small><b>(16)</b></small> And the gift is not
like the one who sinned. For
judgment, resulting from the
one transgression, led to
condemnation, but the gracious
gift from the many failures
led to justification.
