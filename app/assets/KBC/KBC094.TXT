Mount of Thy redeeming love

Here I raise to Thee an altar
Hither by Thy help I'm come
And I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandring from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood
=
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandring heart to Thee
Prone to wander Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart; O, take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above
