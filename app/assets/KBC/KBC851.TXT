Romans 10:8-14
=
<small>(8)</small> But what does it say? "THE WORD
IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH
AND IN YOUR HEART"--that is, the
word of faith which we are preaching,
<small>(9)</small> that if you confess with your mouth
Jesus as Lord, and believe in your
heart that God raised Him from the
dead, you will be saved; <small>(10)</small> for with the
heart a person believes, resulting in
righteousness, and with the mouth he
confesses, resulting in salvation.
=
<small>(11)</small> For the Scripture says, "WHOEVER
BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
<small>(12)</small> For there is no distinction between
Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord
of all, abounding in riches for all who
call on Him; <small>(13)</small> for "WHOEVER WILL CALL
ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED."
<small>(14)</small> How then will they call on Him in whom
they have not believed? How will they
believe in Him whom they have not
heard? And how will they hear without
a preacher?
