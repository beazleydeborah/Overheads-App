If you then be risen with Christ
Seek those things which are above
Where Christ sitteth
At the right hand of God
Set your affections on things above
Not on the things of the earth
For you are dead and your life
Is hidden with Christ in God

You are dead, you are dead
You are dead and your life is
Hidden with Christ in God
Set your affections on things above
Not on the things of the earth
For you are dead and your life
Is hidden with Christ in God
