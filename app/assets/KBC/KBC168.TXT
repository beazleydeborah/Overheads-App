My rest is in heaven,

My rest is not here,
     E            A%     
Then why should I murmur
     B          E%     
When trials are near?
   A%                      
Be hushed, my sad spirit;
    D              A%
The worst that can come
                 D%
But shortens the journey
     E         A%
And hastens me home

It is not for me
To be seeking my bliss,
And building my hopes
In a region like this;
I look for a city
Which hands have not piled,
I pant for a country
By sin undefiled
=
For the Lion of Judah
Shall break every chain
And give us the vict'ry
Again and again.
(repeat)
=
Let trial and danger
My progress oppose,
They only make heaven
More sweet at the close;
Come joy or come sorrow,
Whate'er may befall,
A home with my God
Will make up for it all.
=
For the Lion of Judah
Shall break every chain
And give us the vict'ry
Again and again.
(repeat)
=
With Christ in my heart,
And His Word in my hand,
I travel in haste,
Through an enemy's land;
The road may be rough,
But it cannot be long,
So I journey on,
Singing the conqueror's song.
=
For the Lion of Judah
Shall break every chain
And give us the vict'ry
Again and again.
