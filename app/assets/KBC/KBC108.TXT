Light the Fire
=
I stand to praise You
But I fall on my knees
The spirit is willing
But the flesh is so weak
=
Light the fire   (light the fire)
In my soul   (in my weary soul)
Fan the flame   (fan the flame)
Make me whole   (make my spirit whole)
Lord you know   (Lord you know)
Where I've been   (where I've been)
So light the fire in my heart again
=
I feel Your arms around me
As the power of Your healing begins
Your Spirit moves through me
Like a mighty rushing wind
=
Light the fire   (light the fire)
In my soul   (in my weary soul)
Fan the flame   (fan the flame)
Make me whole   (make my spirit whole)
Lord you know   (Lord you know)
Where I've been   (where I've been)
So light the fire in my heart again
