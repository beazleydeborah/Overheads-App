Come, now is the time to worship
Come, now is the time to give your heart
Come, just as you are to worship
Come, just as you are before your God
Come
=
One day every tongue
Will confess You are God
One day every knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure
Remains for those
Who gladly choose You now
=
Come, now is the time to worship
Come, now is the time to give your heart
Come, just as you are to worship
Come, just as you are before your God
Come
