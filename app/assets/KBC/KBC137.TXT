Ephesians 2:8-10
=
For by grace
You have been saved through faith
And that not of yourselves
It is the gift of God
(repeat)
=
Not as a result of works
So that no one may boast
(repeat)
=
For we are His workmanship
Created in Christ Jesus
For good works
Which God prepared beforehand
So that we would walk in them
