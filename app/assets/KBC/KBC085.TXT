Above All
=
Above all powers
Above all kings
Above all nature
And all created things
Above all wisdom
And all the ways of man
You were here
Before the world began
=
Above all kingdoms
Above all thrones
Above all wonders
The world has ever known
Above all wealth
And treasures of the earth
There's no way to measure
What You're worth
=
Crucified, laid behind the stone
You lived to die rejected and alone
Like a rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall and thought of me
