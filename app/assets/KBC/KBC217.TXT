A Debtor to Mercy Alone
=
A debtor to mercy alone
Of covenant mercy I sing
Nor fear with God's righteousness on
My person and offerings to bring
The terrors of Law and of God
With me can have nothing to do
My Savior's obedience and blood
Hide all my transgressions from view
=
The work which His goodness began
The arm of His strength will complete
His promise is Yea and Amen
And never was forfeited yet
Things future nor things that are now
Not all things below or above
Can make Him His purpose forgo
Or sever my soul from His love
=
My name from the palms of His hands
Eternity will not erase
Impressed on His heart it remains
In marks of indelible grace
Yes I to the end shall endure
As sure as the earnest is given
More happy but not more secure
The souls of the blessed in heav'n
