The Bible Stands
=
The Bible stands like a rock undaunted
'Mid the raging storms of time
Its pages burn with the truth eternal
And they glow with a light sublime

The Bible stands 'tho the hills may tumble
It will firmly stand
   when the earth shall crumble
I will plant my feet on its firm foundation
For the Bible stands
=
The Bible stands like a mountain tow'ring
Far above the works of men
Its truth by none ever was refuted
And destroy it they never can

The Bible stands 'tho the hills may tumble
It will firmly stand
   when the earth shall crumble
I will plant my feet on its firm foundation
For the Bible stands
=
The Bible stands and it will forever
When the world has passed away
By inspiration it has been given
All its precepts I will obey

The Bible stands 'tho the hills may tumble
It will firmly stand
   when the earth shall crumble
I will plant my feet on its firm foundation
For the Bible stands
=
The Bible stands ev'ry test we give it
For its Author is divine
By grace alone I expect to live it
And to prove it and make it mine

The Bible stands 'tho the hills may tumble
It will firmly stand
   when the earth shall crumble
I will plant my feet on its firm foundation
For the Bible stands
