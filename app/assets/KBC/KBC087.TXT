Forever My Love
=
The nails in Your hands,
The nail in Your feet
They tell me how much You love me
The thorns on Your brow
They tell me how
You bore so much pain to love me
=
And when the heavens pass away,
All Your scars will still remain,
And forever they will say
Just how much You love me
So I want to say
=
Forever my love,
Forever my heart,
Forever my life is Yours
Forever my love,
Forever my heart,
Forever my life is Yours
=
The nails in Your hands,
The nail in Your feet
They tell me how much You love me
The thorns on Your brow
They tell me how
You bore so much pain to love me
=
And when the heavens pass away,
All Your scars will still remain,
And forever they will say
Just how much You love me
So I want to say
=
Forever my love,
Forever my heart,
Forever my life is Yours
Forever my love,
Forever my heart,
Forever my life is Yours
It's Yours
