When Elisha woke
surrounded by the forces
Of the enemies of God,
the enemies of God
He saw the hills aflame
with angels on their horses
So in the night my hope lives on

I see the slave that toils
beneath the yoke unyielding
And I can hear the captive groan,
hear the captive groan
For some hand to stay
the whip his foe is wielding
Still in the night my hope lives on
=
I see the armies of the enemy approaching
And the people driven, trembling, to the shore
But a doorway through the waters now is opening
So in the night my hope lives on
=
Oh in the night, oh in the night
Oh in the night my hope lives on

Like the son who thought
he'd gone beyond forgiveness,
Too ashamed to lift his head--
but if he could lift his head
He would see his father
running from a distance
In the night my hope lives on
=
I can see the crowd of men retreating
As he stands between
the woman and their stones
And if mercy in his
holy heart is beating
Then in the night my hope lives on
=
Oh in the night, oh in the night
Oh in the night my hope lives on
=
I remember how they
scorned the son of Mary
He was gentle as a lamb,
gentle as a lamb
He was beaten, he was
crucified, and buried
And in the night, my hope was gone
=
But the rulers of this earth
could not control Him
No they did not take his life--
He laid it down
all the chains of death
could never hope to  hold Him
So in the night my hope lives on
=
I can see the Son of Man descending
And the sword He swings
is brighter than the dawn
And the gates of Hell
will never stand against Him
So in the night my hope lives on
=
Oh in the night, oh in the night
Oh in the night my hope lives on
