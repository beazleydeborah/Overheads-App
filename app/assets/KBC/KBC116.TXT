Rock of Ages

        A    D         A%
Rock of ages cleft for me
       Bm      E7     A%
Let me hide myself in Thee
        E7            A%
Let the water and the blood
         E7                 A%
From Thy riven side which flowed
              D       A%
Be of sin the double cure
        Bm        E7        A%
Save me from its guilt and pow'r
=
Not the labors of my hands
Can fulfill the law's demands
Could my zeal no respite know
Could my tears forever flow
All for sin could not atone
Thou must save and Thou alone
=
Nothing in my hand I bring
Simply to Thy cross I cling
Naked come to Thee for dress
Helpless look to Thee for grace
Foul I to the fountain fly
Wash me Savior or I die
=
While I draw this fleeting breath
When my eyes shall close in death
When I soar to worlds unknown
See Thee on Thy judgment throne
Rock of ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
